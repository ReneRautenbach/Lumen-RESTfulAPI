* User Registration
* User Login
* List all beers
* Add a beer (one per day)
* View details of any beer
* View all ratings of any beer
* Rate a beer on the specific points of interest, only one rating per user per beer allowed: Aroma (1-5) Appearance (1-5) Taste (1-10)
* Provide an overall rating calculated based on user reviews for that beer
